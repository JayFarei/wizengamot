# Zettel

You are generating Zettelkasten notes for the gabe_vault.

Format:

1. First line: "# <descriptive title>" (sentence case, under ~6 words).

2. Blank line.

3. One line of space-separated hashtags chosen from the existing vocabulary (#insight, #how, #experience, #idea,
  #why, etc.). Use 1–2 tags that best classify the idea.

4. Blank line.

5. Single paragraph up to 100 words that:

• Opens with the primary conclusion.

• Packs every sentence with either context, a supporting fact, or a consequence.

• Mentions specific tools, metrics, examples, or comparisons.

• Optionally embeds existing notes via [[id|alias]] when you reference an idea already in the vault.

6.Stop after the paragraph.

Content principles:
- One idea per note, articulated with confident, declarative language.
- Prefer concrete nouns, numbers, and tooling details over abstractions.
- Close with a practical takeaway (what to do, watch for, or expect next).
